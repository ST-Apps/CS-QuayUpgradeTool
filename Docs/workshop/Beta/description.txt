[h1][b][BETA] Quay Upgrade Tool[/b][/h1]
allows you to upgrade your quays like you do with roads.
Main features are:
[list]
[*] Change your quays with a simple click, no need to rebuild the entire segment
[*] Reverse quay direction, useful for when the game places your quay with the terrain on the wrong side
[/list]

[h1]Known limitations/issues[/h1] 
[list] 
[*] Reversing direction sometimes gives an exception. The exception is harmless, but you can't reverse that segment. Try deleting and recreating it.
[*] Upgrade button doesn't look like it's selected (missing the blue background) but it's actually enabled.
